# My Portfolio

## Description
Hello, I built this password generator in order to seek improvement on my Javascript. My biggest challenge was finding out how to nest what function or what variables where and why. Another challenge I had was how to begin the code - I ended up just taking it step by step figuring out one portion at a time and stepping through the code.

## Installation

User will need to install and use within a web browser (EX: Google Chrome, Safari, IE, Mozilla Firefox) in order to open the password generator link - https://https://derekthecarrot.github.io/PasswordGenerator/

## Usage

In order to use and open this project, please visit https://derekthecarrot.github.io/PasswordGenerator/ within any web browser.
After that, if you click the generate password button - it will run a function that will bring up windows asking how long you want your password to be. It cannot be less than 8 characters and it cannot be more than 128. If you try those, it will not let you and send a prompt stating to choose one that meets the parameters. Once you choose one that meets the parameters - it will ask you if you want Uppercase, Numeric, Lowercase, or Special Characters. Depending on what you click - it will generate a password in the box with the series you have selected.
